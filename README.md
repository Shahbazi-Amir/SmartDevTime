Title:
Predict Time to Complete IT Projects using ML

Description:
We are looking for a Junior to Mid-level Machine Learning Developer to build a predictive model that estimates how long IT projects will take to complete.

Youâ€™ll work with a dataset containing information about past projects (type, team size, experience level, complexity, etc.), and your task will be to preprocess the data, build a regression model, evaluate it, and deliver predictions and insights in a clear report.

Expected deliverables:

Cleaned dataset

Jupyter Notebook with well-commented code

Final model (pickle or joblib)

Visualizations showing data relationships and model performance

Final report (Markdown and README)

Tech stack preferred: Python, Scikit-learn, Pandas, Matplotlib/Seaborn
Bonus if you use advanced models (e.g. XGBoost) or demonstrate good model interpretability (SHAP/LIME).

Time: ~30 hours
Budget: $200â€“250
